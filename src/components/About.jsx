        Hi, my name is Adekola Thanni,
        <br></br>
        Iâ€™m a Fullstack developer and a UI/UX designer, I started my coding
        journey in the year 2019 and since then it has been a rollercoaster
        ride, not complaining though. Learning stacks after stacks, building
        projects upon projects has been my mission for the past years now.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>I work <span className="text-purple-secondary">Remotely </span>
        with the best tools possible to create High end, SEO optimized, Fast and
        Responsive web apps.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        The tools I work with?
      </p>
